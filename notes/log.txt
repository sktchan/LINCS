apr 8, 2025 - flux.transf.jl
this is what was used for original 2D input into mhsa (which doesn't work, needs (k, q, v) input)
function (tf::Transf)(input::Float32Matrix2DType) # input is features (978) x batch
    sa_out = tf.mhsa(tf.norm_1(input)) # OG paper states norm after sa, but norm before sa is more common?
    # x = input + tf.dropout(sa_out)
    x = input + sa_out
    mlp_out = tf.mlp(tf.norm_2(x))
    # x = x + tf.dropout(mlp_out)
    x = x + mlp_out
    return x
end
